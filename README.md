In this video we continue our progress with the Ultra96 FPGA with the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC! We add to the base project, mainly because we need a clock, and write a verilog RTL for the PL, or fabric, of the FPGA. We do so by creating a verilog module and adding an external output. Finding the correct pin to use can be a pain but don't worry, we cover that in the video and theres a few helpful links below. Have a great day and don't forget to Love Well!</br>
